No monolithic import required.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Behavior Layer</h2>\n<h3>@gentleduck/primitives</h3>\n<p>Unstyled, accessibility-first component primitives. These handle the hard parts -- focus trapping, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, click-outside dismissal -- so you bring only your design.</p>\n<p>Includes primitives for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dialog, Drawer, Sheet</strong> -- Modal and dismissible surfaces</li>\n<li><strong>Popover, Tooltip</strong> -- Positioned floating elements (built on Floating UI)</li>\n<li><strong>Slider</strong> -- Range input with full keyboard support</li>\n<li><strong>Navigation Menu</strong> -- Accessible menu navigation patterns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every component in the <code>registry-ui-duckui</code> package is built on these primitives. If you want to build your own design system, start here.</p>\n<h3>@gentleduck/motion</h3>\n<p>Animation and transition utilities designed to pair with duck-variants. Handles enter/exit animations, mount/unmount transitions, and staggered sequences.</p>\n<p>Motion primitives are used by Dialog, Sheet, Drawer, Tooltip, Popover, and Dropdown Menu for their open/close animations.</p>\n<h3>@gentleduck/vim</h3>\n<p>Keyboard navigation engine inspired by vim's modal editing. Powers the command palette, menu navigation, and keyboard-driven interfaces across duck-ui.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>How They Compose</h2>\n<p>The power of the ecosystem is in composition. Here is how a single component -- <code>Button</code> -- uses the stack:</p>\n<p>&#x3C;MermaidDiagram chart={<code>flowchart LR     A[\"@gentleduck/libs\\ncn() for class merging\"] --> D[\"Button Component\"]     B[\"@gentleduck/variants\\ncva() for variant styles\"] --> D     C[\"@gentleduck/primitives\\nSlot for polymorphism\"] --> D     D --> E[\"Exported from\\nregistry-ui-duckui\"]     E --> F[\"Installed via\\n@gentleduck/cli\"]     style D fill:#e8ffe8,stroke:#333     style F fill:#fff8e8,stroke:#333</code>} /></p>\n<p>A more complex component like <code>Command</code> composes multiple layers:</p>\n<p>&#x3C;MermaidDiagram chart={<code>flowchart TD     Libs[\"@gentleduck/libs\"] --> Command     Variants[\"@gentleduck/variants\"] --> Command     Primitives[\"@gentleduck/primitives\\nDialog, Popover\"] --> Command     Hooks[\"@gentleduck/hooks\\nuse-debounce, use-composed-refs\"] --> Command     Motion[\"@gentleduck/motion\\nEnter/exit animations\"] --> Command     Vim[\"@gentleduck/vim\\nKeyboard navigation\"] --> Command     Command[\"Command Component\"]     style Command fill:#e8ffe8,stroke:#333</code>} /></p>\n<p>Each layer is independently useful, but the composition patterns are where the ecosystem creates the most value.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Adopting Incrementally</h2>\n<p>You do not need to adopt everything. Each package is published independently on npm:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Just need class name generation?\nbun add @gentleduck/variants\n\n# Just need hooks?\nbun add @gentleduck/hooks\n\n# Want headless primitives?\nbun add @gentleduck/primitives\n\n# Want the full component library?\nbunx @gentleduck/cli init button dialog input\n</code></pre>\n<p>Start with what solves your biggest pain point. Expand as your needs grow.</p>\n<callout title=\"Shared conventions, independent packages\">\n  Every package follows the same patterns: TypeScript-first, tree-shakeable, zero or minimal dependencies, independently versioned. You control what you adopt.\n</callout>",

This post covers everything that shipped.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Recharts v3 Migration</h2>\n<p>Upgraded all charts from <strong>Recharts v2.15.1</strong> to <strong>Recharts v3.7.0</strong> across 6 packages. This is a major upgrade that brings server-side rendering, better accessibility, and smaller bundles.</p>\n<h3>What changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>Change</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Recharts v3.7.0</strong></td><td>Upgraded across all 6 packages that depend on recharts.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Accessibility by default</strong></td><td>Removed explicit <code>accessibilityLayer</code> prop from 47 chart files. In v3, accessibility is enabled by default.</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>activeIndex</code> migrated</strong></td><td>Replaced the removed <code>activeIndex</code> prop on <code>Bar</code>/<code>Pie</code> with Tooltip <code>defaultIndex</code> in 3 components.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type imports updated</strong></td><td>Consolidated <code>PieSectorDataItem</code> from deep import path to the main <code>recharts</code> export.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SSR via <code>next/dynamic</code></strong></td><td>Registry build system now generates <code>next/dynamic({ ssr: true })</code> instead of <code>React.lazy()</code>. Components are server-rendered while still code-split on the client.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No loading spinners</strong></td><td>Removed the <code>React.Suspense</code> loading fallback from <code>ComponentPreview</code>.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3>Before and after</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">// Before (v2)\nimport { PieSectorDataItem } from 'recharts/types/polar/Pie'\n\n&#x3C;PieChart>\n  &#x3C;Pie activeIndex={0} data={data} accessibilityLayer>\n    ...\n  &#x3C;/Pie>\n&#x3C;/PieChart>\n\n// After (v3)\nimport { type PieSectorDataItem } from 'recharts'\n\n&#x3C;PieChart>\n  &#x3C;Pie data={data}>\n    ...\n  &#x3C;/Pie>\n  &#x3C;ChartTooltip defaultIndex={0} />\n&#x3C;/PieChart>\n</code></pre>\n<callout title=\"No changes needed on your end\">\n  The chart API is unchanged for consumers. Your existing chart code works as-is. Charts now render on the server, so there is no flash of \"Loading...\" on page load.\n</callout>\n<hr>\n<h2>Documentation Overhaul</h2>\n<p>A comprehensive rewrite covering every component and package page in duck-ui.</p>\n<p>&#x3C;MermaidDiagram chart={<code>flowchart TD     A[\"57 Component Pages\"] --> B[\"API Reference Tables\"]     A --> C[\"Philosophy Sections\"]     A --> D[\"Mermaid Diagrams\"]     A --> E[\"Callout Icons\"]     A --> F[\"Cross-Links\"]     D --> G[\"Composition Diagrams\"]     D --> H[\"Dependency Diagrams\"]     I[\"9 Package Pages\"] --> C     I --> D     I --> J[\"Architecture Overviews\"]     style A fill:#e8e8ff,stroke:#333     style I fill:#e8ffe8,stroke:#333</code>} /></p>\n<h3>API Reference Tables</h3>\n<p>Every component page now includes a formal <strong>API Reference</strong> section with prop tables documenting types, defaults, and descriptions.
