## 59+ Components, Zero Lock-In

Duck UI is a component library built on top of the GentleDuck ecosystem. It ships over 59 production-ready components covering forms, navigation, data display, overlays, and layout.

But unlike most component libraries, duck-ui does not install as a dependency. Instead, the CLI **copies source code directly into your project**. You own every line. You can read it, modify it, delete parts you do not need, and never worry about a breaking upstream update.

## The CLI Workflow

Adding components is one command:

```bash
# Initialize a new project with components
bunx @gentleduck/cli init button dialog input select

# Add more components later
bunx @gentleduck/cli add command combobox data-table
```

The CLI:
1. Resolves dependencies between components (e.g., `combobox` needs `popover` + `command`)
2. Copies source files into your project
3. Installs npm dependencies (`@gentleduck/primitives`, `@gentleduck/variants`, etc.)
4. Configures Tailwind CSS if needed

### Why Copy Source?

Most component libraries are black boxes. You install a package, use the API, and hope the defaults work for your design. When they do not, you fight the abstraction with CSS overrides, wrapper components, or abandoned forks.

Duck UI takes a different approach:

- **Full control** -- Every component is a file you own. Change the border radius, swap an icon, add a prop, remove a feature.
- **No version lock** -- You are not coupled to upstream releases. Your code, your pace.
- **Learn by reading** -- The source is right there in your project. See exactly how a dialog manages focus or how a combobox handles keyboard events.
- **Tree-shaking by default** -- You only have the components you use. No unused code in your bundle.

<Callout title="Component-as-code">
  When you run `@gentleduck/cli add button`, you get the full `button.tsx` source in your project. It is not a dependency -- it is your code now.
</Callout>

## Built on the Ecosystem

Every component is built using the same GentleDuck packages you can adopt independently:

- **@gentleduck/primitives** -- Headless behavior (focus, keyboard, ARIA)
- **@gentleduck/variants** -- Type-safe styling with `cva()`
- **@gentleduck/hooks** -- React hooks for component logic
- **@gentleduck/motion** -- Enter/exit animations
- **@gentleduck/libs** -- Utilities (`cn`, `Slot`, `Portal`)

The components are the reference implementation of these packages working together. Reading the source teaches you how to build your own components using the same patterns.
